Previous scenario:
We receive around 80,000 batches (EOB Files, pdf) from the client (Athena) everyday. Each batch may have one or muliple transactions.
EOB Files -> contains doctor mention about the cost for each medical code/treatment provided.
Data entry person manually key in the cost details in the Offline internal application from these EOB files which takes lot of time.
From this offline application, remit file (text file format) is generated and this is posted to Athena by data entry person.
Currently 30% of these files are handled with echopay automation. rest 70% are done by data entry persons.

Echopay automation:
OCR is done on the EOB file and text extracted and mapped to the DB fields. It is retrieved in the offline application and remit file generated. (Check)

Flow:
Once this EOB remit file is posted to athena, then only the payment would be processed by payer and released.
